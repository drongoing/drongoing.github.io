This is a first post. An obligatory hello, and a brief note on why this site exists.

## Why a personal site?

There's something useful about having a small corner of the internet that's yours — not a social media profile, not a resume portal, just a place to put things. Writing forces clarity, and clarity is worth pursuing.

I plan to write here about whatever I'm working on or thinking about: research, code, ideas that seem worth sharing. No fixed schedule, no particular theme requirement.

## What's here

The site has a few sections:

- **About** — a short bio and links
- **Projects** — things I've built or contributed to
- **Gallery** — photos
- **Blog** — this, right here

That's about it. Simple by design.
