excerpt: "Some thoughts on the act of building — why the process matters as much as the output, and what I've learned from making things that didn't quite work."

Building things is a strange activity. You start with an idea — sometimes clear, often vague — and end up with something that almost never matches the original picture.

## The gap between idea and execution

There's a gap between what you imagine and what you can actually make. This gap shrinks with experience, but it never fully closes. Most of the interesting work happens in that space: the back-and-forth between intent and reality, constraint and creativity.

I've found that the most useful lesson from building things isn't technical. It's learning to be comfortable with imperfection while still caring about quality. These aren't opposites.

## Finishing as a skill

Finishing things is genuinely harder than starting them. The beginning is energizing — the constraint hasn't arrived yet, everything is still possible. By the time you're 80% done, you know exactly what's wrong with what you've built, and it takes real effort to push through.

But something exists once you finish it. Nothing exists until then. That asymmetry matters.

## A note on tools

Good tools get out of the way. The best hammer is one you don't think about while using it. I try to apply the same standard to the software and systems I build: if a user is aware of the tool, something has probably gone wrong.

More on specific tools and projects in future posts.
