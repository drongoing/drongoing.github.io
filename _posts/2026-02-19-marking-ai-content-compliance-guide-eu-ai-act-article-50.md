title: "Marking AI Content: A Compliance Guide for EU AI Act Article 50"
date: 2026-02-19
excerpt: "Article 50 of the EU AI Act requires AI-generated content to be marked in a machine-readable format that is effective, interoperable, robust, and reliable. With enforcement beginning in August 2026, no major provider is currently compliant — and the window to close that gap is narrowing."

Article 50 of the EU AI Act establishes the first binding requirements for AI content marking in a major jurisdiction. By August 2026, providers of AI-generated content must mark outputs in a machine-readable format that satisfies four conjunctive criteria: **effective**, **interoperable**, **robust**, and **reliable**. Non-compliance carries penalties of up to €15 million or 3% of global annual turnover.

The December 2025 Draft Code of Practice translated those criteria into an operational mandate: multi-layer marking is required. Metadata-only approaches (such as C2PA) fail robustness because metadata is stripped by screenshots and social media uploads. Watermark-only approaches fail interoperability because proprietary detection locks out third-party verification. Neither layer alone is sufficient — both are required.

An assessment of ten major providers — including Google, OpenAI, Meta, and Microsoft — finds compliance gaps across the board. The technical path forward exists: C2PA v2.3's soft binding specification enables hybrid architectures that satisfy both robustness and interoperability. But providers without watermarking infrastructure already in place face serious implementation risk, as integration typically takes six to twelve months.
